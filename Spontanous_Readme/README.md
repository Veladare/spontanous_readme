## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a ReadMe generator to make it easier for users to create a ReadMe by using the terminal.

In completing this project, I learned how to use module export, gained a better understanding of switch cases, how to use inquirer and how to transfer data from one file to another and creating new files via fs.writefile to generate a file from the terminal.  
## Installation 

To use, install vscode and npm install.

## Usage

Once installed, start the questionnaire by typing node index.js. After completeting this, a new ReadMe will be generated.
